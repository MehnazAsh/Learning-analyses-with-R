Data analyses

Data analyses recently caught my attention and am loving it so far.I am taking lessons from Udacity in descriptive statistics,
inferential statistics and data analyses using R.Learning through practice is the best,this blog will contain all examples I have worked through and will work while learning analyses using R.
